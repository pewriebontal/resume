summary: "For the last 3 years, I have built better systems when existing ones were broken, from replacing my university’s timetable system with my own app to engineering a POSIX shell in C. With projects spanning a suite of AI productivity tools to solve problems in productivity, developer tooling, and academic learning to censorship-resistant infrastructure, I bring systems-level expertise to solving difficult problems with clean, effective code in C/C++ and Go, and DevOps alongside full-stack development in Python and Node.js. I’m now looking to apply these skills to build impactful, resilient products."
