summary: "For the last 3+ years, my approach has been simple: if software is broken, I build something better. This mindset began with hacking games and has since driven me through intensive, project-based work to solve real-world problems. I've replaced my university's broken timetable system with my own app, engineered a UNIX shell from scratch in C, and built AI tools that translate plain English to code. I thrive on solving difficult problems with clean, effective code, and Iâ€™m now looking to apply my full-stack experience in Node.js, Go, and Python to a team that builds impactful products."
